A scratch-built wheeled biped robot similar to that of
Ascento from ETH Zurich or Boston Dynamics' Handle v1. All hardware and electronics are 
currently done (before something blows up...), currently working on the controllers.
I aim for it to be able to follow people around and be very agile with its roller wheel legs!
