A little SLIP (Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum) sim I made when I first joined the Dynamic Robotics
Laboratory. It's a rather simple reduced order model for this one, just standard no leg mass SLIP.
Controllers I implemented went from simple P controller, Raibert controller, and Ernst-Geyer-Reinhard Blickhan(EGB) controller.
