I was a Captain of my high school's Botball robotics team. I probably spent more time at Botball than any classes I ever took in high school.

Botball is a robotics competition for high school students. Unlike competitions such as FIRST or Vex, Botball is a fully autonomous robotics competition, meaning there is much more emphasis on software and designing robots that are robust given hardware limitations. Since there is no human controller, robots must have built in recovery mechanisms, as even the smallest of errors can send the robot spiraling out of control.

The robots are given a wide variety of tasks, such as collecting certain game pieces or sorting items by color. You can check out a practice run of one of the main robots I worked on here.

    While I was on the team, we won:
    1st place in New England Regional Competition 2015, 2016, 2018
    1st place in Global Competition, 2015
    3rd place in Global Competition 2016
    6th place in Global Competition 2018
