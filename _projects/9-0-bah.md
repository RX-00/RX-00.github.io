I was a systems operations intern back in high school at the military contractor and consultant group: 
Booz Allen Hamilton. You may know them due to Edward Snowden haha. While there in the Lexington branch I worked within
the air force division. It was pretty cool being right next to an airforce base and seeing all the
different types of planes fly around overhead! Again, can't divulge too much info again here for
obvious reasons.
