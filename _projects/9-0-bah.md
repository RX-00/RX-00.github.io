I was a systems operations intern back in high school at the military contractor and consultant group: 
Booz Allen Hamilton. You may know them due to Edward Snowden haha. While there in the Lexington branch I worked within
the air force division. It was pretty cool being right next to an airforce base and seeing all the
different types of planes fly around overhead! Again, can't divulge too much info again here for
obvious reasons.


At Booz Allen I really connected with and learned the inner mechanisms of the military industrial complex. Right before being hired I had become a young AFCEA (Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association) member, being invited to some events and meeting with some military top brass. BAH really introduced me to what it was to see industry research put into action (albeit slowly) and their direct effects on the world around us.
