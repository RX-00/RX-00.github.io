A 3D printed carbon fiber modded MOCO quadruped that I am making for MassRobotics. Currently still in development haha. Mainly made for research and educational STEM purposes in the future. The electronics are custom, the stl's are modded by me based on the MOCO quadruped base, and the software is written by me.
