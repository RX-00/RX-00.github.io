I was lucky enough to be able to work with the digit sim (from Agility Robotics)! Thanks to my
old PI (he himself isn't old haha), Dr. Jonathan Hurst! Currently I'm working on implementing 
novel research controllers, such as the amazing new LIP controller from UMich (legendary controls
prof, Jessy Grizzle) based on angular momentum about the contact point for bipedal robots (which was
implemented on Cassie but not Digit).
