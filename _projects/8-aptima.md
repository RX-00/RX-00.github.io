Description of aptima: did drone work, did brain controlled robotics
Military contractor I worked with back in early high school. I did computer vision (OpenCV in C++) for
some predator drones (can't divulge more info, you know the drill). Also helped out with the ROS side
for a brain controlled robotics project with, if I recall correctly, was a Kinova arm!
