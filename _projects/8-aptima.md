Military contractor I worked with back in early high school. I did computer vision (OpenCV in C++) for
some predator drones (can't divulge more info, you know the drill). Also helped out with the ROS side
for a brain controlled robotics project with, if I recall correctly, was a Kinova arm!


This place was where I think I truly began to love what industry had to offer in terms of robotics and research. I was lucky enough to have been scouted out after bumping into some Aptima people at a local event. They were really impressed by my facial recognition and tracking camera I built from scratch back in freshman year of high school. After a fun dialogue with the engineers they even offered to tour me around their lab and office. Later Aptima extended out an offer for an internship after an interview too!
