Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller for self-research for my scratch-built wheeled biped.
Started off with cartpole and then onto more detailed models for the wheeled biped. Though now
I am debating whether to try out a reduced order whole body controller (WBC) based on some new
papers I'm reading, "Speed and Acceleration Control for a Two Wheel-Leg Robot Based on Distributed
Dynamic Model and Whole-Body Control."
