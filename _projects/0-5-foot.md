Physical models and reduced order models I made for the research of the effects of various
damping configurations with springs on the impact forces of foot strike with the ground.
The work I did later ended up in an ASME paper and later journal under Jesse Rond. Thanks Jesse!
In the research I turned down the offer of having my name listed as author as I felt that a good
chunk of the research I did was out of the scope of the initial paper and then later IP issues
prevented me from investigating further to publish a second follow up paper. I'm happy with the
results though and am excited to see what Agility Robotics comes out with for the physical
phenomemon investigation of dynamic locomotion (in this case foot transient impacts)!
