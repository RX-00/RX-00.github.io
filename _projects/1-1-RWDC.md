I was the lead engineer in my high school's team for the Real World Design Challenge in which we
designed a drone service for autonamous agriculture and pest control. We were able to win first
place in states (MA) and thus we were flown to Washington D.C. to attend the internationals.
	Along with our States First Place win we were also invited to the senate to receive these awards:
	
	Letter of Commendation by Commonwealth of MA Speaker of the House for Achievement in STEM In recognition of winning the RWDCState Championship and National Challenge Merit Award
	
	Official Citation by Commonwealth of MA State Senate for excellence in STEM In recognition of winning the RWDC State Championshipand National Challenge Merit Award
