Early robot I made from scratch back in my early high school days. The wires were a mess, programs
not properly managed, and man was I not the best at self-documentation back then haha. In the end
it used a kinect 360 to perform SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) and had a little arm
to grab objects that could be specified by the user from some OpenCV code I wrote.
