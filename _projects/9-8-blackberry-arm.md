My good friend (previous co-worker, and also my former senior robotics team captain) Will Becker and I
worked on modifying an open source Trossen Robotics arm to reach a lower price point while keeping as
much operational payload as we could. This included modifying the STEP files and changing out 2020
aluminum extrusion to carbon fiber. Currently the Blackberry resides with Will of which he'll program
to do cool things!
