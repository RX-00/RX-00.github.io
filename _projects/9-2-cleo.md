Cleo Robotics is one of the startups within MassRobotics. They are creating an insanely novel
single duct drone design, they call the Dronut (drone + donut lol). I do some contract work
for them on the ROS side. In the future (when I have more time) I aim to help out with
some of the control systems work and vision systems too.
