This little customized turtlebot3 robot of mine was capable of SLAM, obj rec, and obj manipulation.
I self-funded through my internships with military contractors. I used it to further advance the
work I had personally done on my old Fetch robot. Right now I turned it into an inverted pendulum
and am working on making a new arm for it haha.
