I spent a lot of time working on and with Cassie (from Agility Robotics, spin-off of the DRL) back
when I was at the DRL (Dynamic Robotics Laboratory). One of my favorite robots hehe. I hope to be
able to work on the one at Harvard too while I'm in Boston still!

This lab is where I really flourished and came into my own academically and research wise. I'd be in in the morning with my fellow graduate students and always be one of the last ones out to lock up. Between classes I would be in the lab to always be doing research or maintenance on our robots. I was finally allowed to really branch my wings for robotics without hindrance and ample resources, taking on grad level projects and problems. I even was offered my name on a paper and subsequent journal but I turned it down due to feeling my research was too out of scope for that specific paper. Later due to IP issues with our spin-off startup I decided not to pursue my then current research topic and played around with the idea of taking up my PI's offer of working at his startup, Agility Robotics and work on humanoid bipedal robots.
