My current workplace as of fall 2019!! I love it here, the community is amazing and all the crazy
new robotics research and industry advancements is awe-inspiring. I really recommend to drop by
and visit the space (when this virus is gone of course!). I help out the startups here kinda like
a consultant or contractor. When I'm not doing that I act as the assistant lab manager, keeping
all the robots and equipment up and running, which kinda bleeds into my other role as a robotics
technician here, ie robo rangler, which has been a really cool experience to work with cutting-edge
robots! I also build and design robots for the space too, including a gripper for some of the
co-bot arms and a mini quadruped robot.


MassRobotics is where I was able to heal myself after some health concerns and hospitalization. I truly love it here, the community, all the research and startups under the MassRobotics banner. I think MassRobotics really solidified my affinity and drive to not only better myself and my own craft in robotics but also lift up others. I think MassRobotics embodies why robotics is so special as a field, everyone is so collaborative, we all know that if we want to bring our collective dreams for our robots to life then we must ban together and help even in rivalry. I aim to always be a part of the MassRobotics community even when I'm an old roboticist teaching the next generation of the arts of robotics.
