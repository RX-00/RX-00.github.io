My current workplace as of fall 2019!! I love it here, the community is amazing and all the crazy
new robotics research and industry advancements is awe-inspiring. I really recommend to drop by
and visit the space (when this virus is gone of course!). I help out the startups here kinda like
a consultant or contractor. When I'm not doing that I act as the assistant lab manager, keeping
all the robots and equipment up and running, which kinda bleeds into my other role as a robotics
technician here, ie robo rangler, which has been a really cool experience to work with cutting-edge
robots! I also build and design robots for the space too, including a gripper for some of the
co-bot arms and a mini quadruped robot.
