Just a guy wanting to bring out the artistry within robotics to the world

Currently I'm working at the wonderful MassRobotics, love being able to work with the cutting edge in industry and the startups here in Boston.

In my personal time I mainly like to work on robos too, ranging from Agility Robotics' Digit Humanoid simulator (trying to get the new LIP controller from UMich to work on Digit v2 right now) and some scratch built robots like a Boston Dynamics's Handle-like bipedal wheeled robot.

I also love to read, listen, and learn more on art and art history (it's not useless I swear by it!).


My vision and goal of robotics stems from my belief that robotics is one of the most expressively transformative things people can create. I also love how dynamic robots can be but I think they can convey even more than expressive motion. The fact that we can create mechanical beings capable of the ability to not only be helpful but give people comfort or care is so utterly amazing. I used to dream as a little kid about the idea of robots that roam around the world with humans, helping us like benevolent familiars. Robots that walk the desert in order to provide people internet and warn people about sandstorms. Robots that run along the streets to help keep them clean and provide people directions. Robots that provide care for the elderly and enable those who cannot be physically present at least be tele-present with their loved ones. I believe robots are capable of becoming more than just simple machines but rather helpful companions for all of humanity.



PSA: I highly rec the original Ghost in the Shell movie and Stand Alone Complex series

Feel free to reach out if you wanna talk, hang out, or discuss why Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Francis Bacon are surprisingly similar artists.
